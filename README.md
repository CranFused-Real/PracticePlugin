# PracticePlugin for Minecraft

PracticePlugin is a PaperMC plugin designed for Minecraft version **1.20.1**. It adds some functionalities to your server for testing purposes.
This plugin is made for testing and educational purpose! If you want a dedicated plugin, please wait till I develop a new plugin after some testing :)

PracticePlugin will send players a message in yellow text whenever they jump in the game.

**Requirements:** The player who executes the '**/jump**' command must have **server operator** privileges.
